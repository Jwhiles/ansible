# Faster-than-light ~communication~ osx setup

I use this project to configure my macOS the way I like it. That way I can wipe
and re-install with less effort. See ~my~ the [blog post](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/20/how-i-provision-my-macbook-with-ansible/) written by the person I forked it from.


## How to use it

```shell
1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) with the command from the site
2. Install the xcode command linetools
3. Install ansible
4. `make run`
5. Open nvim and run `:PackerSync`
```
